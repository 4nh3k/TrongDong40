# TrongDong40
This is a 40% layout, Alice clone keyboard I designed. This was designed for my future hand-wired project, and it's my first time designing a keyboard, so it's not the best, but I'm trying to make it look good, be compatible with most of the keycap set, and fit my needs.
The Keyboard name mean Bronze Drum in Vietnamese, it's the sacred symbol of my national culture.
